A few minor errors have been reported in the User's Guide

(1) Section 5.1, p. 35; equation (5.1b) should read

    r^2=(x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2

(2) Section 5.1, p. 37; the third line from bottom of the listing
    should read

    twod=cos(rr*nn*pi)**2 *exp(-rr**2/sigma2)

    Likewise in the listing given in Sectin A.3, p. 97
