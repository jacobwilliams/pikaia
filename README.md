Modern Fortran Edition of the Pikaia Genetic Algorithm

# Status

![Build Status](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/pikaia/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

# Overview

This is a refactoring of the PIKAIA unconstrained optimization code from the [High Altitude Observatory](http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/pikaia/pikaia.php).  The original code is public domain and was written by Paul Charbonneau & Barry Knapp.  The new code differs from the old code in the following respects:
 * The original fixed-form source (FORTRAN 77) was converted to free-form source.
 * The code is now object-oriented Fortran 2003/2008.  All user interaction is now through the ```pikaia_class```.
 * All real variables are now double precision.
 * The random number generator was replaced with calls to the intrinsic Fortran ```random_number``` function.
 * There are various new options (e.g., a convergence window with a tolerance can be specified as a stopping condition, and the user can specify a subroutine for reporting iterations).
 * Mapping the variables to be between 0 and 1 now occurs internally, rather than requiring the user to do it.
 * Can now include an initial guess in the initial population.

# Compiling

A build script, `build.sh` is provided in the project root directory. This script uses [FoBiS](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS) to build the pikaia library and an example program.

# Examples

 * An example use of Pikaia can be found [here](http://degenerateconic.com/earth-mars-free-return/).

# Documentation

 * The API documentation for the current ```master``` branch can be found [here](http://jacobwilliams.github.io/pikaia/).  This is generated by processing the source files with [FORD](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford).  Note that the shell script will also generate these files automatically in the ```doc``` folder, assuming you have FORD installed.
 * The original Pikaia documentation (for v1.2) can be found [here](http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/pikaia/relnotes.ps).
